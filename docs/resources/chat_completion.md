resource "openai_chat_completion" "my_chatcompletion" {
  frequency_penalty = 5
  function_call = {

    {
      description = "...my_description..."
      name        = "Carlos Halvorson"

## Schema

### Required

- `messages` (Attributes List) A list of messages comprising the conversation so far. [Example Python code](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/How_to_format_inputs_to_ChatGPT_models.ipynb). Requires replacement if changed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--messages))
- `model` (String) ID of the model to use. See the [model endpoint compatibility](/docs/models/model-endpoint-compatibility) table for details on which models work with the Chat API. Requires replacement if changed. ; must be one of ["gpt-4", "gpt-4-0314", "gpt-4-0613", "gpt-4-32k", "gpt-4-32k-0314", "gpt-4-32k-0613", "gpt-3.5-turbo", "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k", "gpt-3.5-turbo-0301", "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613"]

### Optional

- `frequency_penalty` (Number) Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.

[See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](/docs/api-reference/parameter-details)

Requires replacement if changed. ; Default: 0
- `function_call` (Attributes) Controls how the model responds to function calls. "none" means the model does not call a function, and responds to the end-user. "auto" means the model can pick between an end-user or calling a function.  Specifying a particular function via `{"name":\ "my_function"}` forces the model to call that function. "none" is the default when no functions are present. "auto" is the default if functions are present. Requires replacement if changed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--function_call))
- `functions` (Attributes List) A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for. Requires replacement if changed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--functions))
- `logit_bias` (Map of Number) Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

Accepts a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

Requires replacement if changed.
- `max_tokens` (Number) The maximum number of [tokens](/tokenizer) to generate in the chat completion.

The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length. [Example Python code](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/How_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken.ipynb) for counting tokens.

Requires replacement if changed. ; Default: "inf"
- `n` (Number) How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Requires replacement if changed. ; Default: 1
- `presence_penalty` (Number) Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.

[See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](/docs/api-reference/parameter-details)

Requires replacement if changed. ; Default: 0
- `stop` (Attributes) Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.

Requires replacement if changed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--stop))
- `stream` (Boolean) If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT. Tokens will be sent as data-only [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format) as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message. [Example Python code](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/How_to_stream_completions.ipynb).

Requires replacement if changed. ; Default: false
- `temperature` (Number) What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.

Requires replacement if changed. ; Default: 1
- `top_p` (Number) An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.

Requires replacement if changed. ; Default: 1
- `user` (String) A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. [Learn more](/docs/guides/safety-best-practices/end-user-ids).

Requires replacement if changed.
